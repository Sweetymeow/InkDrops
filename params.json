And the same was implemented in the Polymer project as well. So this is just a small breakdown for the same using jQuery and CSS.\r\n###[Demo Here](http://akhilarjun.github.io/InkDrops/demo.html)\r\n##How To :\r\nFirst include the _inkdrop.css_ ,_ink.js file_ and _jQuery_ to your page\r\n```html\r\n<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='css/inkdrops.css'></link>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src='js/ink.js'></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src='js/jquery.min.js'></script>\r\n```\r\nThen all you have to do is add a class '_inkMe_' to the containing element that needs the ink drop effect. And Voila! when you click the element you could see the ink drop dripping<br>\r\n```html\r\n<a class='inkMe'>Regular Link</a>\r\n```\r\n##Customize \r\nYou can also change the color of the ink ripple by using the *ink-color* attribute\r\n```html\r\n<button class='inkMe' ink-color='#fff'>White Ripple on Button</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso you can add multiple ink-drops overlapping one another by using the *multiple-ink* attribute\r\n```html\r\n<button class='inkMe' ink-color='yellow' multiple-ink=true>Button with Multiple Ripples</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Does not work with IE8 and below versions :rage2:*\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
